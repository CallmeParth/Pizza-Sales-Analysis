# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I had analyzed Pizza Sales data from an CSV file, then I used MySQL to build KPIs and some trends like Daily & Hourly Trends for Total Orders and others, then I used Excel to clean and process the data after that I created a dashboard using Excel to give some insights on those data. 

Programming Languages Used: 1. Microsoft Excel.
                            2. MySQL.
